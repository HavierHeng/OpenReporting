Backends
- Main one to attempt to store user data - JWT auth, saving configs in sqlite3, and saving docx to some folder
- One for the docxpl stuff for jinja formatting
    - mammoth.js simple preview might be a separate microservice
- One for chatbotting with langchain (later on i will add api tokens and ollama support on the frontend settings)
